# Project-Solaris

**Project-Solaris** is an educational mobile game developed using **Unity**, aimed at engaging 5th to 8th grade students in learning physics through interactive and creative gameplay. The project addresses the lack of interest in traditional educational games by offering an innovative approach that combines modern technology and gamification to enhance learning experiences.

## About the Project

Many educational games for middle school students (grades 5–8) fail to capture attention and engagement. Traditional learning methods often don't encourage creativity or curiosity. **Project-Solaris** aims to solve this by using modern technology to create a fun, interactive, and personalized learning experience that sparks interest in physics and improves academic performance.

### Project Goals

The main goal of the project is to create a mobile educational game that:
- Increases interest in physics among 5th–8th grade students
- Integrates NFC technology for interactive learning
- Aligns with modern educational needs and individual learning preferences

### Key Objectives

- Conduct user research to define the value and direction of the project
- Analyze product development context (macro/micro environments, user needs, competitors, financial and technical aspects)
- Design and implement the educational game using Unity, incorporating NFC interaction
- Document project outcomes and suggest future development directions

### Methodology

The development process followed the **SCRUM** methodology, with clearly defined goals, task lists, sprint planning, team velocity calculations, and retrospectives. This agile approach ensured adaptability and iterative progress throughout the project lifecycle.
